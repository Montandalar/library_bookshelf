# Minetest Mod: Library Bookshelf

This mod adds a bookshelf based on the one from Minetest Game. It has the
additional functionality of being able to create infinite copies of a written
book that is placed inside of it.

The mod was inspired by a node from Your Land server which I couldn't find
published. I decided to implement it myself from scratch.

## Usage

To craft a library bookshelf, place a mese crystal to the right of a bookshelf
in the crafting grid.

To make a copy of a book, simply grab it from the shelf and put it in your
inventory. The original copy will be kept.

Only those with protection access to the area the bookshelf is placed within may
place or remove books from the shelves. Anybody can make infinite copies of the
books.

To remove books from the shelf, you will need a skeleton key. Place the skeleton
key on top of any book you want to remove, and remove the book into your
inventory. Then remove the skeleton key from the bookshelf. Repeat for all books
you want to remove.

If you want to remove the whole shelf without keeping anything, you will
probably find it quicker to use WorldEdit to remove the bookshelf instead.
